## Description
The idea of this project is intended to allow the user to pick a computer programming language to start out learning.
The real purpose is to give me, the maker the chance to create a submittable form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is also intended to provide me with an opportunity to utilize newly gained skill of the user interface aspect of JavaScript.

## Known Bugs

* Only the first question in the survey changes the result from the default of suggesting the user should learn JavaScript
