  Include a form with a minimum of 5 survey questions.
  Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
  One branch should return one result. It shouldn't be possible to be suggested two languages at once.
  Make sure that when the user submits the survey again (for a second or third time), that previous answers are hidden,
  cleared, or replaced prior to showing the new result.
  Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in
  tone.
  A Few Important Notes
  For the branching logic, you are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to
  use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good
  functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages.

  Programming Language Suggester
  Create an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Keep in mind
  that even though all languages have similarities and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both
  internships and jobs, applicants should still put some thought into which language they should learn.

  Choose at least three languages that prospective learners should consider. Here are some possibilities:

  Ruby
  C#
  JavaScript
  Go
  Python
  Rust
  Swift
  Feel free to pick any language that interests you, either from this list or from your own research.

  Then create a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs) that asks future
  students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask
  questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else
  you find relevant. Note that you are not required to research the languages extensively and you can even choose silly
  or irrelevant questions to determine which language would be best — for instance, people that like singing in the rain
  may prefer Ruby while chihuahua lovers might prefer C#.

  Include a form with a minimum of 5 survey questions.
  Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
  One branch should return one result. It shouldn't be possible to be suggested two languages at once.
  Make sure that when the user submits the survey again (for a second or third time), that previous answers are hidden,
  cleared, or replaced prior to showing the new result.
  Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in
  tone.
  A Few Important Notes
  For the branching logic, you are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to
  use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good
  functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages.

  Do not use window methods to interact with the user. This includes window.alert(), window.confirm(), and
  window.prompt(). Instead use a form to gather user input and event handler properties or event listeners to handle
  events. To display the survey results to the user, you can show and hide HTML or update the values of existing HTML
  elements to communicate results.

  It is also not required to publish your project to GitHub pages, but you may do so if you wish.

  Objectives
  Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

  Form gathers input from the user.
  Branching is used to determine the result.
  Web API object properties or methods (not including window methods for alerting, prompting, or confirming) are used to
  display the result to the user.
  Event handler properties or event listeners are used to handle events.
  When the user submits the form again (for a second or third time) previous results are hidden, cleared, or replaced.
  Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
  Web page is styled using custom CSS.
  Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
  The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
  What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
  When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

  You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing
  information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure.
  You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach. Make sure that your:
  Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only
  necessary comments and debugging tools.
  Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…".
  What are the baseline project requirements?
  All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

  A complete and informative README
  It is not required to include a link to your site hosted on gh-pages, but you are welcome and encouraged to do so!
  The project's commit history demonstrates that the project’s required work schedule and hours have been met:
  8 hours completed on Friday is required for full-time students
  4 hours completed over the weekend is required for part-time students
  Completion of the project based on the prompt and objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and
  features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work
  session to make sure that you are not missing anything.
